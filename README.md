# Colm Kilduff's Personal Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I store my personal data science and visualization projects. This repository features projects across a range of topics, including Shiny applications, geospatial visualizations, and other data-driven explorations. 

## Projects

### 1. Slope Visualization of the Lower Mainland (Shiny App)
A local Shiny app that visualizes slope gradients in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, Canada. This project uses geospatial data to create an interactive map where users can explore slopes for outdoor activities like snowboarding and skiing.

#### Key Features
- **Slope Filtering**: Set minimum and maximum slope angles for targeted visualization.
- **Color Mapping**: Visualize slope steepness with a color-coded gradient.
- **Map Legend and Search**: Navigate the map with a detailed legend and location-based search options.

#### Technologies Used
- `R` and `Shiny` for app development
- `leaflet` for interactive mapping
- `raster` and `terra` for geospatial processing
- `shinyMobile` for mobile-friendly UI design

## Getting Started
